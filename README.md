Invitees: Howard, Ece, Christine, Amy, Carl, Tom
Regrets: Karrie (Karrie & I have discussed the topics for today)

Agenda/Notes:
## Group check
Anything significant in the moment someone wants/needs to share?
CNI updates

## In a year's time, what do we want to exist?
Based on the DSWG responsibilities listed in the charge,
individually articulate what we want and is reasonable to expect to exist in a year's time for each responsibility. For this articulation we will avoid discussion of how, and focus on succinctly identifying the desired short term outcomes. 
As a refresher, these responsibilities are: 
1. To serve as a communication and transparency node
2. To help the MIT Libraries analyze what we are currently doing with regard to Digital Scholarship
3. To help the organization learn
4. To guide decisions, resources, pilot projects and service design efforts by making recommendations
5. To assist with cross-dept coordination

__Please come prepared with 'headline' versions of what each responsibility looks like a year from now. What exists for this responsibility?__
*Even better, write each one on a sticky note, and bring those!* ('Not sure' is also an acceptable answer)

## Aggregation
We will take a moment and aggregate the achievable outcomes in each responsibility area

## Deciding
We will be using dot methodology to allow each person to identify the top three things they think should exist a year from now.
