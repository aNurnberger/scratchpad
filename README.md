	- Won't have posters until end of next week
		- Because of logo error on part of sponsor
		- Waiting to ask Ned to swap the new logo in
	- Pixie, Kaija up for some organic postering
	- We are seeing more posters and foot traffic than three weeks ago. A last minute blitz would not be a loss. But if they are made, they should be used

	- Got lots of good suggestions. Working to organize pulls and putting on shelf
	- Probably have enough now to put up by end of week
	- What poster should be used? There might be one in the area? 
		- Could do a "Collections Highlights" thing for Afro-Latine authors
		- Use the right design template, please
	- Would like a news item on the web site for the Collections Highlight
		- [ ] S will do this, essentially like a reading list w links
	- Is it possible to have a title suggestion for the collection? a link to a form, or something? on the Collections Highlights poster? Maybe to a suggested purchase form??
		- [ ] S will manage

		
## Planning upcoming events:

- Fall 2022 event
	- Nina/Tina have relationship w autobiographical writing class where students pitch book for MIT Reads. Have identified a theme from last year's notes: tie-in w mental health issues, student mental health
	- PArtners:
		- S^3 thrilled to partner on this theme.
		- Mental health & counseling
		- Fall timeline challenging for student participation
	- May Mental Health month could give an opportunity to help start interest, collection suggestions, etc.
	- Wellness collection at Hayden could use some development & suggestions...
	
- Spring 2023 event
	- Asst Dean from CoC reached out to partner. Will pull whole CoC to contribute thoughts on diversity and inclusion in he computing area
	- [ ] Nina will contact Phoebe about level of involvement

- Comment: While planning ahead like this may seem to block off participation/suggestions from students, there are other opportunities where Community Engagement supports these efforts

## MIT Reads Membership

- Current membership: 12
	- New members: Emily, Tina C, Aya
- We will also be getting ARL Diversity Fellow for Community Engagement
- Are there needs not currently being met?
	- Pulling together, writing & formatting marketing content
		- Could be good work for Fellow
		- No one stepped up to lead the marketing team
		- Marketing is a skill, and maybe an actual marketing person should be paid for that work, not voluntary
		- Decision: This marketing lead role will be assigned to fellow.
- What does having a signed agreement for represented folk mean for this team?
	- Everyone's participation is valued. People have been able to contribute where they enjoy.
	- Until there is a clearer decision about how work gets structured, keep doing what you've been doing
	- Things change and there may be new configurations, and we should still enjoy working together

    	- For NEXT summer: Does it make sense for the summer to close early on Friday of holiday weekends?
    		- Limited utility for facilities to stay open late
    		- Increased traffic
    		- Sometimes a lot of other campus stuff going on?
    		- NDM: Some concern at Friday before Labor Day b/c lots of newbies on campus exploring spaces

    	- Skills development, mentoring, growth in community engagement role, which is an emerging role in Libraries
    - How will each department meet with her and participate in onboarding
    	- Sylvia: Teaching, Engagement, Long-term goal is management. Newly minted MLIS. 
    	- Would like on-boarding to include individual meetings to understand departments and their work with Libraries and community
    	- Outreach to student groups
    	- Work on program vision for space in Bldg 3, The Den
    	- Develop presence for Community Engagement program on public web
    	- On Campus, hybrid, after 4Jul. In Hayden for 1st year, then Rotch.
    - When do we want to invite her to RLL
    	- Nina's call
- Amy and Karrie: Computation/Research Data Support discussion | 40 min
	- Outcome/Purpose for initial RLL conversation
		- Get us talking together about data-intensive research and computational research as a long term adaptive challenge for the library to which our directorate will contribute
			- KP: We're all trying to align depts w NUV. We're good at that within depts, looking at how to do better b/t depts, as a directorate. 
			- AN: Combining the two points on 
				- We will prioritize an open scholarship agenda that accelerates the progress of science, promotes equity and inclusion across disciplines, and reduces the marginalization of scholars and scholarship from disadvantaged communities.
				- We will invest in staff, services, and tools to support data-intensive and computational research and learning.
		- Learn each other's situations, plans, challenges
	- We're asking each unit (IDLA, LIRS, CE, Music, DSS) to prepare for this:
		- Activity #1 -- 20 min: In round-robin style, 4 min max per unit (e.g., only Lisa or Karrie would speak but not both)
    		- What kinds of aspirations do you have?
     		- How does data enter into the services and support that your unit provides on campus?
     			- KP/LIRS: We have clientele & constituencies and operate via relationships. There is generalize program, and their individualized relationships and approaches. Starting point five years ago, that if it was data, it was with DSS. It is becoming more obvious that LIRS needs to be conversant with a more holisitic products of research. Leanring how to figure out what this looks like. Looking at general knowledge for all liaisons, and customized knowledge for disciplinary needs & relationships.
     				- General: Carpentries, Privacy, Indigenous knowledge, Purchased data infrastructure, Funder & publisher policies
     				- Individual: Digging into data, Data in the Disciplines
     				- 4 aspirations:
     					- Establish competencies
     					- Issues w Machine Learning
     					- Better routines for funneling business intelligence back to Libraries with service design
     					- Different relationship with DSS
     			- NDM/Community Engagement: Least likely to see self here, but does! One aspiration is in the digital first realm. We've been successful lin launching a rich & varied event program. There is a huge appetite for Live-streaming, recording, hybrid,including remote participants. This costs money. Are under-resourced in expertise and equipment. Something revelatory was event on Feminist Data. Helped to understand importance an d value of different kinds of data and representing different data. Work to be done in exploring uses of data and experiencing data. Kai's event on student artwork using textiles to represent climate change and flood plains in Boston was great. Project that didn't go: student project that was projection of constellations that would be influenced by foot traffic. This program has a lot of potential to work with people around campus to play with conceptions around data and its uses.
     			- FW/IDLA: We have ppl with enthusiasm for outcomes in terms of equity & SJ that could be supported by data work. Not a lot of skills, though. Really thinking about the data that access services collects with minimal context, e.g., what have the numbers been doing over time. Interested in taking numbers and turning them into decision drivers. How do we make our numbers into meaningful feedback. We need better information on the outcomes. Don't know what impact of Libraries services are to student outcomes. Are there other areas of the Libraries that IDLA can work with. Thinking about outcomes as part of data collection design. Using data for storytelling.
     			- AB/Lewis: This is very niche, and very inter-disciplinary. It's very humanities-centered. 
     				- Data Intensive applications might include data from places like billboard, but these commercial programs aren't something we focus on at MIT. Don't see a lot of use of datasets. Interested in Music Encoding initiative -> Encodes music documents in machine readable structure. Text mining. 
     				- Computation research side: Doing a lot n this area. CASC visiting artist grant that is focused on machine learning in the arts. a lot of interdisciplinarity. Open source application 
     			- AN/DSS: Felicity took notes
     			- 
    	- Activity #2 -- 15 min -- general discussion
    		- What challenges do we have in fully embracing the strategic direction (as described in the NUV) as a directorate?  What separates us, what overlaps do we have?
    		- How do we raise the level of discourse around data in the directorate?
    			- Come together around clear or well-defined holistic service catalog for R&L. How do all of these things fit together?
    		- Community engagement and connected learning
    		- For ppl in IDLA around events. If something goes wrong, what are the implications for service in social justice. In what ways is equity seen in our policies.
    		- Nuances in understanding research and their connections to it
    		- Amy said some things. Who knows what they were
    			- Information Services Training program addresses some of the challenges around understanding connections between work of different depts
    			- a Goal of every directorate meeting should be to increase understanding of connections between depts' work and to the NUV
    		- Could each group come and talk excitedly about how their work connects w NUV?
    		- There is value in a shared discourse across directorate about dept contributions to NUV.
