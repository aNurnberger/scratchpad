Tests and such

As requested, this project page captures that work plan: https://wikis.mit.edu/confluence/x/lykaC , but it still needs some refinement. So, this meeting is for:

•	Confirm appropriate project participants

	- Sheila at Lyrasis wanted a tech contact. It is Osman.
	- Beverly is now in Distinctive Collections. This authority work might be better for someone else. e.g., Spoke w Kim like maybe Beth Brennan, 
	- Rep from MIT press: 
	- Laura will be main contact w Sheila at Lyrasis

•	Agree to success measurements

Agreed.

•	Assign tasks for next action phase

	- Lib guides

	- on boarding
		- combining ORCIDs
	- MIT Press workflow
