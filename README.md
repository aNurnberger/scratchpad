Present: Beth Barnett, Rachel Besen, Laura Hanscom, Christine Malinowski, Amy Nurnberger (chair & notes)
Regrets: Howard Silver

For this meeting, the aims are to:

##	Welcome new members to the project from Metadata & MIT Press (Amy, Beth, Rachel)

- Rachel, MIT Press journals production manager
- Beth, Metadata librarian
	
##	Review current use state of ORCiDs @ MIT information, https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b39ifXHV0Ip8SC2nB77Z7p1Xh_LRVdL3sQR7iH7H11A/edit?usp=sharing (Laura)

- Currently we don't...
-  90% of faculty have ORCiD, but is not activated. Choice to have individual control ORCiD profiles
- Lydia Snover's office has let go of most responsibility. Institutions have not been assigning ORCiDs/
- There is an Atlas process for MIT profiles to either add existing ORCiD, or get new one.
- There is some legacy information in the ATLAS that should be removed.
- Q: Of those created, do we know how many are in use?
	+ A: It's hard to see, and there are complexifying issues.
- We did a first push in 2015, but there has been limited follow-thru. We don't have the infrastructure to support this, in terms of RIS. There is a lack of incentive for researchers to use it here.
- Q: Is there institutional interest in using ORCiDs this way
	+ A: Not really. we are de-centralized! Would take some powerful high-level influencing.

##	Show off Libguide update (Laura)

- This is done. Links are updated. IS&T links are good, they have an API key for general use. Laura has screen shots of what it used to be.
- [ ] CM will take a second look at it.

##	Review current ORCiD assigning practices (Laura)

- Institutions are not allowed to assign. There are information sources available. There are pathways through ATLAS and through IS&T.
- MIT Press manuscript management system doesn't currently direct authors to contact their local institutions for a new ORCiD. 
- [ ] RB could make suggestion to editors to add this information into author instructions.

##	Discuss current & desirable ORCiD workflows at MIT (Amy)

- Current: 
	+ Institute: get kicked from IS&T or ATLAS or LibGuide to MIT ORCiD signup.
	+ Press: Pop-up that directs ppl to ORCiD sign up page if they don't have an ORCiD. This is through a manuscript management system.
	
- Future:
	+ OATF does not touch on this, but can't do OATF without something like ORCiD. Maybe through the department level plan.
	+ RB, MIT Press: We would like authors to have ORCiDs, but it's really more about the collection of ORCiDs & managing that process through the publishing process itself. There are 41 journals, only a small subset has a MS mgmt system that can collect & validate ORCiDs.  There are not good processes for the other journals. Would like to build a tool to do the verification internally w authors. Some resistance to collecting the ORCiD b/c don't want to create barrier to submission through requiring ORCiD. Editor's perception that authors would perceive it as a barrier
	+ CM, Data management: Anyone who is producing data should have an ORCiD. Research Data Registry. Machine readable & accessible data. We should promote this as much as possible. Very important for FAIR data & computational access for data. Necessary for machine actionable DMPs.
	+ BB, metadata & cataloging: We make sure that recorded metadata and authority management works. ORCiD is great for this. We need to get ORCiD data into the systems. There are places in the authority record where ORCiD could be. ORCiDs are not currently being used in a bulk way in authority records. Not in the authority system at this point in time. Not in Vera, Barton or DSpace.
	+ LH, SCCS: We are very interested in tracking and indexing scholarly output and work. ORCiD is a good tool for doing this. There is also a funding aspect of this. Most federal funders are requiring this for grant applications. This is necessary for their tracking, too. Necessary for EDISJ because it opens up assessment, current practices in naming have great variety that do poor service for presenting a body of work for scholar based on a naming basis. Names are poor identifiers.
	
The ideal:

- Everyone have ORCiDs & authorize MIT for ORCiD as trusted organization & collect information for profile
	+ ORCiD onboarding
	+ ORCiD set up to collect data & steward profile
	+ ORCiD supported by MIT
- Place for ORCiDs in metadata/cataloging
	+ ORCiD in DSpace
- ORCiDs in P&T
- ORCiDs publication processes
	+ Validating ORCiDs in publication process outside of MS mgmt systems
- Waking up old ORCiDs

- It would be great if checking for ORCiD was part of on-boarding.

##	Assign workflow development & documentation tasks

Develop a handful of potential workflows to support the noted goal.

- On-boarding faculty (Christine & Laura)
- Stewardship of the ORCiD (Laura & Amy)
- ORCiD in the publication process (Rachel & Beth)

##	Action item review

- Register ORCiD Board voting preferences w Laura
- Amy setting up Nov mtg, have workflows to discuss then
