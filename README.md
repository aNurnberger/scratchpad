========

Present: Phoebe Ayers, Jennie, Daniel, Howard, Madeline, Christine, Amy
Regrets: Rob Caplin, Ye
Note taker: Amy

Howard: It's a new semester! Usually exciting, there are issues, though. The work that libraries do matters, whether mundane or experimental. Thanks to everything that the DSS group brings to the work of the Libraries and the Institute.

Portal update (Christine & Madeline)

- Project proposal has been put together for the UX Portfolio
- Project is part of overall web design work on the slate for UX
- Proposal link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AvNRXa2kZoMqS0TbGOuveGjjJV-_7ff0zQHQQi-NZfw/edit?usp=sharing
- Hope to be speedy. Will be asking other DSS members for input, but will be on tight timeline. (so please respond quickly)
- Hoping for kickoff in mid Nov & completion by spring semester start
- Q: Just a start? Wordpress?
	- A: Yes, just a start. Expect it to be wordpress. Expect it to replace several other data related sites.
- Q: Link to data reference?
	- A: Yes. meant to approach data from the users perspective.
 
1. Climate report: Howard will lead a discussion on the climate report, focusing on 1-2 themes.  We will discuss ideas on how to correct issues identified in those themes.   Please review the report here before the meeting:
 
https://wikis.mit.edu/confluence/download/attachments/136875940/MIT%20Academic%20Climate%20Survey%20Results-ALL_LIB.pdf?api=v2  (30 minutes)

- Noticings:
	- Libraries response rate ~50% vs Institute response rate of ~20%
	- Good to see quantifications of discontent.
	- Libraries' discontent is frequently higher than MIT discontent on same topic
	- p. 8: Libraries distinct from MIT. Lib lower than MIT on Diversity & Inclusion
	- p. 4/5: Regarding satisfaction. Those numbers are unfortunately low.
		- It's possible to be happy, but recognize that the org is not good for early career people.
	- Satisfaction gap b/t salary/hourly groups.
	- Response rate for hourly seems lows
	- Is there a report beyond the data presented in the slides? Is there further (more useful) analysis?
	- What is the goal with these results? Is it understanding differences or meeting a goal/benchmark?
	- Standouts (negative) in comparing Lib to MIT: fairness, promotion, review, politics
		- Politics seemed quite an extreme standout. There is a shared distress across the organization.
	- People graded their supervisor relationships more positively than their satisfaction w the org
	- Admin staff reported supervisor issues at a higher rate than hourly
	- Hourly has more issues w promotion
	- Contextual information around respondents may be hiding some of the survey's richness
	- There are some more specific questions here, e.g. is intellectual competitiveness a problem. Do we care? What would we do?
	
Given this, what are next actions?

[ ] There is a lot of information presented in these images, but there is also a lot of information not presented. Is there information beyond what is presented in the slides?
[ ] Could be useful to consider how the org is going to respond to these results, especially given that quant tells you what, not why or how. e.g. is intellectual competitiveness a problem. Do we care? What would we do? Stress of workload. How might we dig more deeply into this?

Given these, it may be early for DSS to start thinking about actions and where our agency sits.
 
 
2. Hires that affect us: Amy and Daniel will talk about the several hires across the Libraries that will affect us and how DSS leadership, and others in DSS, provided feedback as the positions were developed. (10 minutes)

Things we won't be talking about: DLS hires
What we will be talking about:

- LIRS vacancies
- DSS conversations w LIRS re: vacancies
	- Roles in new positions that would connect them more harmoniously w DSS, particularly areas in DMS, stats, analysis
	- The reasoning behind the search committee members shows that our ability to communicate and work with LIRS was successful
	- Good to have constructive conversations with other depts about how positions and services can reinforce each other
- This position is not explicitly about data, but know that this position is searching someone w technical skills, e.g. ML, programming, stats, etc. The committee will be able to sort through what is available in applicant pool
- Q: What will the Engineering & Science Librarian will do. Don't see the data piece clearly written in here, although that's what it seems people are interested in
	- A: Environmental engineering, maybe some civil, maybe some EAPS, IDSS, College of Computing with Phoebe...somehow..., data stuff
- Good intent to collaborate and not repeat work, but strengthen it
- DSS conversations w SCCS: Collections position
	- SCCS has been diligent in trying not to replicate what DSS is doing.
- These conversations are welcome progress. The expression of good faith across unit boundaries is refreshing for the org. In Nov all-staff there will be a panel to talk about open positions and the process of how we got there. 
 
3. LMSI agenda: Howard, Amy, and Daniel will discuss how we share decision making responsibilities, depending on the nature of problems we face. We will have a few slides showing decision making styles and will discuss how we can implement these, and when. (30 minutes)

(Include slides in notes)

- Timeliness can also be a factor, but may sometimes be used as an excuse
- It's possible to do all of these styles well or poorly. Sometimes the issue is execution, not style.
	- communication about decisions
	- gaining consensus
- If there is a style we frequently use, we could focus on getting better at that style
- Something else to explore is respectful speaking dynamics. A constructive flow that leads to a decision.
- Know when a decision point must be reached.
- Acknowledging the variety of decisions that can exist in an effort
- What is the spectrum of space decisions?
	- Who needs to be at a table for input & sign-off, and how quickly can that happen
	- Timeliness is a large factor
	- Issues w inconclusive conversations, and trying to work with those dynamics. It's important to make decision points explicit.
- An important element is trust in the decision style chosen.
- Risk is another factor in the process. 
- Sometimes there is a confusion as to whether you are making a decision or a recommendation.

- When building agendas, we should be conscious of what points require decisions and explicit about how those decisions will be be approached.
 
4. Howard status: Howard will discuss his schedule and how his work as DSS manager will be accomplished while he is attending to space concerns. (10 minutes)

- In Spa-a-a-a-a-a-ace!
- 70% of time now, normalize at 40-50% of time
- Expect until December 2020
- Daniel: DSS agenda & monthly updates, Amy: DSS mgr agenda & monthly reminders, Jennie: Teaching & learning roles, active learning room in Barker
- Work of DSS and representing that work to Libraries is something that Howard will continue to actively do.
- If you sense an area that Howard needs to pay more attention to, please don't hold back. Please approach Howard in a collegial and constructive way.
 
5. Program for information citizenship: Howard describes the current status of work, what he and others are involved in, and what we can expect from the program in the near future.  (10 minutes)

- There is a JLT subgroup: Howard, Karrie, Ellen (and a bit of Emily Hardman)
	- crafting posting for T&L line. In commenting phase
	- presentation for libraries that showcases existing efforts that fall in bounds of Program in Information Citizenship. Will be ~hour, w each dept showcases selected efforts
	- Q: Definition of information citizenship?
		- A: Presentation is demonstration by example. PAIRS process gives a starting definition
	- Q; Who is the audience of this presentation?
		- A: for the Library as a whole. What is the program, how are we currently doing it
	- Clarifying what is meant by "program" would also be useful. Most efforts have not been coordinated in programmatic manner
	- Currently targeting January for presentation...
	- There do remain many questions about the program, its intent, what position would best serve the programs intentions
	- DSS should give input on what a program manager for information citizenship would do, get that to Howard. He will share progress as he can.
