	- Won't have posters until end of next week
		- Because of logo error on part of sponsor
		- Waiting to ask Ned to swap the new logo in
	- Pixie, Kaija up for some organic postering
	- We are seeing more posters and foot traffic than three weeks ago. A last minute blitz would not be a loss. But if they are made, they should be used

	- What poster should be used? There might be one in the area? 
		- Could do a "Collections Highlights" thing for Afro-Latine authors
		- Use the right design template, please
	- Would like a news item on the web site for the Collections Highlight
		- [ ] S will do this, essentially like a reading list w links
	- Is it possible to have a title suggestion for the collection? a link to a form, or something? on the Collections Highlights poster? Maybe to a suggested purchase form??
		- [ ] S will manage

		
## Planning upcoming events:

- Fall 2022 event
	- Nina/Tina have relationship w autobiographical writing class where students pitch book for MIT Reads. Have identified a theme from last year's notes: tie-in w mental health issues, student mental health
	- PArtners:
		- S^3 thrilled to partner on this theme.
		- Mental health & counseling
		- Fall timeline challenging for student participation
	- May Mental Health month could give an opportunity to help start interest, collection suggestions, etc.
	- Wellness collection at Hayden could use some development & suggestions...
	
- Spring 2023 event
	- Asst Dean from CoC reached out to partner. Will pull whole CoC to contribute thoughts on diversity and inclusion in he computing area
	- [ ] Nina will contact Phoebe about level of involvement

- Comment: While planning ahead like this may seem to block off participation/suggestions from students, there are other opportunities where Community Engagement supports these efforts

## MIT Reads Membership

- Current membership: 12
	- New members: Emily, Tina C, Aya
- We will also be getting ARL Diversity Fellow for Community Engagement
- Are there needs not currently being met?
	- Pulling together, writing & formatting marketing content
		- Could be good work for Fellow
		- No one stepped up to lead the marketing team
		- Marketing is a skill, and maybe an actual marketing person should be paid for that work, not voluntary
		- Decision: This marketing lead role will be assigned to fellow.
- What does having a signed agreement for represented folk mean for this team?
	- Everyone's participation is valued. People have been able to contribute where they enjoy.
	- Until there is a clearer decision about how work gets structured, keep doing what you've been doing
	- Things change and there may be new configurations, and we should still enjoy working together

=========

Attendees: Nina, Amy (notes), Cassandra, Karrie, Felicity, Avery, Brigham (guest), Lisa

- Updates
	- NDM: RAK & Study breaks. These are happening. These are assigned tasks, not voluntary. Tasks are assigned in CE group. [Library administrative staff are welcome to participate, tbd]
	- FW: Reminder. Review the DSS's Strategic work XLS and think about it for yourselves - more after thanksgiving (not sure if this is intended to supplant the Gantt chart). What might uncover strategic alliances. There is no due date, it will be revisited afer thanksgiving https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Fkm3AF0Ri8f4yX79reY7CBvS7FguQAcitn2jJCLj0qw/edit#gid=0
	- Ppl for DLS Project Management group: 
		- [ ] Everyone send Karrie names of people we recommend for group, who are eligible. Please do this by Friday, 21Oct 
- Brigham
	- Internal communication group
		- Looking for people.
		- This would be assigned work.
		- Ongoing. Membership for a year
		- What are the kinds of work, what kinds of strengths
	- Specialist slide show	
		- We're talking about the one in Hayden
		- No owner of the slide deck
		- Monitor is an odd/un-useful place
		- Initial goal was motivated by service design team to raise visibility of expertise
			- Feel like we've lost the thread here a bit. At this point, not really sure what people get from big screens. Is there any literature about best use of big screens?
			- BF: We could look at data we have around how ppl hear of events, and see if they are useful for that?
				- [ ] NDM will do this
			- How do we tell if the specialist slides have value?
			- Is there a place, for consultations, where people are asked how they found out about the service?
				- [ ] LH will look if we can use appt service software to do this?
		- Can slide show be re-allocated
			- Ended up splitting up all of the slides that featured individual people
			- Services were already playing in all the Locations
			- When starting to think about how experts were shown, realized we have too many experts!
		- Other options
			- Move monitor to another space
				- Probably not quiet reading room (too distracting)
				- [ ] LH will follow-up on this w Maria
			- Thinking about setting up playlist differently to spread out individual experts
			- Ones that are noticeable are those that have people's faces. Could use this as a filter. Would like slides to focus on events
			- Could think about having slides condensed so that it is group slides by services (w photos), e.g., DUSP, Sci & Eng, 
				- [ ] LH & BF will take a crack at this
	- Always looking for new stories
		- Faculty teaching "Beat of Brazil", historically Lewis hosted a concert for this with outside artists and open to MIT community. Would like to do this in 8Dec, 5pm.
		- Impact and implications of programming in DEN. Is that a news opportunity?
			- Link to DEN events: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JVXHeoloV_vy-diiZWAibDt1Ee-s9Z3R02-I2VrTK8k/edit
			- When we have co-sponsored events we can ask EVENTS ppl to add Libraries as co-host, and this pulls the event into Libraries' calendar
			- Student life calendar space: 
- follow up from discussion last meeting how we as leaders work with our teams and navigate between advocacy and spokesperson behavior.  (30 min) OUTCOME developing some shared understanding/agreement as a leadership team when conversations are action driven and when they are building understanding and trust (or they can be both)
	- This felt like a difficult conversation for RLL. KP also had a conversation w AHW about this. Want to take an opportunity to learning from this as a group.
		- Takeaways for RLL behavior as leaders
			- Spokesperson behavior should be reviewed
				- Better: bring in people, establish position (not just pass-through)
			- Help people who raise issues to understand that there are multiple perspectives and processes to deal with this
- RLL managers mtg
	- FW has asked IDLA to speak to their experience working w and supervising union eligible staff
	- All should show up ready to listen in our highly collaborative environment and understand what has changed
	- While IDL had in charge to do something w CBA, there was a discussion about culture change outside of HR pronouncements & discussions
	- It would be good to have notes for those that can't attend, Tuesday at 2pm
		
+ for Karrie on bringing the meta-topic back
+ appreciate ppl leaning into slide conversation

# RLL 2023-06-20

- Housekeeping
	- Facilitator or cancel July 5?
		- Going once, going twice...Will stay there for a few days, but will likely disappear
    - Set deadline for annual reports due to Alexia
    	- By end of July
    	- For R&L use
    	- Should align w portfolio management work
    		- Wants to see stats, so can use as talking points & evidence for envisioning new services/positions
    		- Narratives around
    			- Belonging, as operationalized in dept
    			- Staffing
- Inconference Debrief and Next Steps  (45 min)
	- Debrief
		- what successes should we build on
			- Felt people had forgotten how important in-person can be
			- Had some amazing cross-departmental conversations in break-out touching on strategic vision and relationship to work. A lot of enthusiasm for mildly directed and more spontaneous convos like this
			- Hearing colleagues talk about their & our collective work was very impactful
			- Overall distribution of social/play/focused time was excellent
			- Received positive feedback when normally in-person event feedback is usually negative. Especially that organization and facilitation was so smooth, with clear directions
			- Brought the intellectual basis for work back into our lives (via Ruha Benjamin, panels). The intellectual content was very accessible
			- Did a good job in aggregate about distributing conference tasks, e.g., owning what we were good at and outsourcing what we're not (catering). Us doing referral to expertise well
			- Avery was a great MC! and games master!
				- It was a great way to get to know people. We did something that created belonging instead of talking about it
				- The NE36 games event was a similar opportunity
			- Good decision to have ice cream
			- Good cross-directorate partnership
			- The importance of bringing people into casual contact with each other to learn about each other and what knowledge people have. The necessity of gathering together as fundamental & essential to our work
			- Were able to focus on what the R&L directorate needed, didn't overprogram
			- Some 40-ish people attended R&L event
		- any lessons learned, things to think about for next time
			- While we've been hesitant to mandate in-person events, we should come back to good practices and have in-person events 2-4 times/yr, to continue building on these relationships
			- Not all gathering must be organized like meetings
			- The need to gather as a directorate for the intent of belonging and discourse vs operations. These are different types of conversations/engagements & relationships
			- The incidental opportunistic meetings, the space to just chat and get to know folks that was discussed as a huge loss while we have been so short staffed was borne out by the success of the R&L session
			- The ability to raise and engage with cross-directorate challenges, e.g., computational access to materials
			- How do we do this as an R&L directorate going forward?
				- Maybe think about picking & choosing the things we do & the formats for the outcomes that we want. These can look differently and behave differently. If a meeting is different than being together, we need to figure out how to come to that planning differently. Need to diversify portfolio how we meet with our teams, because we need to rebuild or build
				- More fun is discussing interesting problems rather than report on accomplishments
			- Plan more in-person directorate meetings. Maybe some single topic or interactive agendas for in-person
				- e.g., Cupcakes & conversation on AI in Libraries
			- Increase in-person participation by making it interesting/FOMO rather than compliance
			- Importance of sharing food together
				- You don't even need a planned day. Just a designated day, two hours, and BYOL together.
			- The mis/disinformation session is something that could be like this
			- Belonging is built through interaction, not programmatic 'sharing of accomplishments'
		- Summation: Needs: talk about accomplishments, share challenges, cross-cutting developments AND belonging and what creates it. Think about a rubric that creates invitationals rather than mandated meetings. (and maybe a new name) This is work that RLL needs to do
			- Could RLL consider trying to program the next 12 months so that we make space for the variety of interactions we want? (must take into account academic calendar)
			- 4X next year is more than enough: 2 traditional directorate meetings and 1-2 gatherings
				- what is the window for follow-up activity to take advantage of the energy
				- R&L Ice cream social after Labor Day
				- What IS the thing that people want us to do again? Ice cream? trivia?
					- Assigned tables to work on creating something together
			- Doing 'teaming' in a hybrid organization. How do we address sense of loneliness, the desire to model and remodel leaderliness(?), express valuation of individuals in MIT Libraries. Exploring the forming together that is important. This change vortex and instability is not unique to MIT Libraries, it is all academic libraries. MIT Libraries have created a unique user- & staff-centered hybrid models. We might invite colleagues from other orgs to come talk to provide some comparison. 
	- Next steps for summer, fall 
		- Continued in person & hybrid R&L relationship building 
		- Next R&L meeting
			- Avery & Alexia to work towards 'traditionally expressed' directorate meetings
			- May be time to do another poll about whether a directorate meeting should be in-person or on zoom (in-conference experience may have changed perspectives)
		- Topics for future RLL‚Äôs with Alexia (e.g., our own RLL leadership skills building was suggested, what other topics?)
