Centralized resources

- GM: conversation w Glenn, Mark, Marty. Endowment did well and this may or may not have an impact. (AOFO)
	- We have to at a more granular level and at the Institute level prioritize and recognize that there are things that need to be prioritized, and perhaps consider shifted models, evolved models
	
- CL: Resources have probably already been spent! Focus will be on leveraging resources that will be able to support a broad number of people. Will be looked at in context of risk mitigation and deferred maintenance. What can we do & what role do we play in what can be discussed.
- Wanted an update on Science Council
	- Talked about the conversation was about systems of scholarship and shifting those with equity.
	- https://t.co/E6yvsuNvoe 
	
- CL: There are discussions around research computing happening for compute, storage for HPC
- CL: Do not say that the Institute hasn't been investing in RDM, rather, the institute's model of decentralization has gotten us this far, but to move forward we need to consider a different approach
	- GM: unlikely that ppl will go forward strongly with a shift in model
- AN: Goals, getting these conversations happening about research compute, data, etc at Institute level. Start those conversations to launch necessary evolution from. 

Next steps

- [ ] AN: Send around capability maturity models, to help define the "it"
- [ ] AN: set next meeting for Jan to check if we are ready to engage in NIH DMSP activities previously discussed.

Greg Moffat

Follow-up on conversation he and Colleen had w Mark, Jessica, and Olu.

Endowment growth grants opportunities. 
Sr leadership team spoke w Mark Silis re: Days of staying, "we'll get to that" are over. We need to be at NIST 800, cmmc level 3, etc. We need a path for how the Institute is moving forward to accomplish this. 
Mark Silis & Olu Brown had mtg w Greg & Colleen 2 wks ago: Let's go!

[ ] AN: Would like me to reach out to others in space around to understand what they're doin and where they are at in these compliance efforts.

	- How to take which steps to get in a University-wide information system (systems of systems) that will meet sponsor and regulatory requirements for storage, usability, for the entire MIT community. 
		(ASU, UofM, Gottingen, )
	- Scope of investment, where to make investments, 
	- How to bring in all of the individual efforts into a linked networky thing so that everyone can use stable systems
	- Timeline: General picture before winter break
	- Purchasing, training, people, policies: the people, systems, structures to make it possible to use the systems
	- Goals:
		- Funder compliance
		- Institutional adoption
		- Sustainable
		- Supporting academic and scholarship goals for productivity, openness, and MIT mission.

- College of Computing report on computing needs

Looking forward to continuing our conversation about socializing NIH Data management & sharing plan requirements with the MIT research community. For quick reference, here is a Summary of the major points. (https://www.dropbox.com/s/qlfbh9f3vt753uo/Handout_nih2020dmsp_summary.pdf?dl=0) I have also invited Laura Hanscom, Head of Scholarly Communications and Collection Strategy to this conversation. Some areas I hope to cover around the changes and expected impacts, along with administrative and researcher readiness include:
 
- Potential areas of concern
	- Researcher knowledge
	- Researcher resources
		- lack of institutional support for data storage
		- faculty advisory group for research computing & advisory space
	- Costing & budgeting, especially for ongoing storage & access
		- hard to parse to particular project
		- hard to work out ongoing costs
	- COUHES & NIH consistency
	- Research administration training
	- OSATT DUA workflows
	- Overall, 
		- Heightened demands for data security
		- Heightened demands for data sharing
		- Faculty & PIs understanding varies widely, both for requirements & resources, and resources are available are variable
			- Needs: guidance & readily available resources
		- Staff in RAS not well positioned to offer guidance. Maybe dedicated resource more familiar with management, sharing, and security.
		
- Areas of collaboration
- Roles/responsibility

CL: Would like to use this to get the issue on the board, not just for NIH.
BV: Research administrators not prepared for these questions
GM: Part of research compliance office is to include two research security officers: Life sciences, and everyone who isn't life sciences. Would be good to have these people talking with each other.
CL: Need to help researchers be more aware of resources today. We can start by communicating w Dept RAs and contract administrators. 
LH: Libraries can also provide expertise in thinking through these ideas.
GM: Should we start bringing in someone who has a financial perspective into this?
	CL: Has to have a bit more clarity about what we need. Institute has wanted to build charge-back models. So, need to work with [finance] to work out what should be F&A & what should be charge-back. What are the resources needed & how will we support it?

Next steps:

- Education & outreach
	- Administrators & research staff
	- VPR can help organize educational offerings & outreach to dept administrators
	- Plan for something in the fall around existing resources & new requirements coming.
		- Note there are other changes coming around undue influence & biosketches.
	- Bernadette work w Carole Trainer & Amy to set up education
