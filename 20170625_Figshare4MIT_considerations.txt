Figshare for Institutions: Considerations for MIT Libraries

# Introductory paragraph:
- Current state of data repos at MIT (DSpace, Dataverse, etc)
- Why looking for solutions now
- Why figshare is a strong consideration (organizatinal investment in Digital Science, data needs report, data repository evaluation project).


# Needs figshare would meet
## Now
- An up-to-date data repository for the Institute's research community
- 
## Future
- 

# Needs figshare would not meet
- Differential control of DOI assignment per disciplinary needs
- Local control of repository infrastructure
- 

# Advantages
- Name recognition
- Already used by Institute's research community
- Publisher integrations
- Integration with other Digital Science products in which MIT Libraries is already invested
- Key-turn operation
	- Support team (unclear to whom: libraries? researchers?)
-
	
# Risks
- Exit strategy
- Branding/marketing confusion
- Values and philosophy
	- Commercial product with uncertain goals and future disposition
	- Use of researcher metadata for sales and other products
-

# Possible implementations
## Time
- Long term
- Short term
## Extent
- Full
- Limited
## Timeline for implementations
## Resources for implementations
- Personnel
- Policy
- Technical infrastructure
